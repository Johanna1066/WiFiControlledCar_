# WiFi controlled car

## **car** project README

This project focuses on controlling a car using an Arduino Nano ESP32. It integrates steering, velocity, obstacle detection, and recieving data from a controller using the ESP-NOW protocol.

## Features
- **Steering Control**: Uses `SteeringServo` objects assigned to specific pins.
- **Velocity and Direction Control**: Uses `Engine` objects assigned to specific pins.
- **Obstacle Detection**: Uses `USsensor` objects to ensure there are no obstacles blocking the car's path.
- **Sensor Data Handling**: Includes tasks for reading and handling sensor data.
- **ESP-NOW Communication**: Receives data from the controller Arduino Nano ESP32 using the ESP-NOW protocol.

## Setup and Installation


### Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Nano ESP32
- Micro servo x2
- DC motors x2
- Motor driver
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Arduino PSU
- Breadboards
- Cables

  
### Software Requirements
- VScode with platformIO
- Arduino IDE
- ESP32 board support installed in the Arduino IDE
- Required libraries: `esp_now.h`, `WiFi.h`, `ESP32Servo.h`, and `semphr`

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   git clone [ https://github.com/Johanna1066/WiFiControlledCar_Car/](https://github.com/Johanna1066/WiFiControlledCar_Car)
   
2. **Open the Project in VScode with platformIO**
Open the files from the cloned repository in VScode with platformIO.

3. **Install Required Libraries**
Required libraries: esp_now.h, WiFi.h, ESP32Servo.h, and semphr.

4. **Upload the Code**
Connect your Arduino Nano ESP32 to your computer and upload the code.

5. **Download the Controller Repository**
Make sure to download the repository for the controller as well.

## Usage
Once the setup is complete and the code is uploaded:

1. Power on your Arduino Nano ESP32.
2. The system will initialize the components and start the task for sensor checking and 
listening for data fr√•n the controller ESP32.
3. The car's steering and engine will be controlled based on the sensor data and commands received via ESP-NOW from the controller.
